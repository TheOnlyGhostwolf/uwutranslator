<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

One of the most important features of uwutranslator is that it doesn't have any prefix - instead, it responds to mentions. So, if you want to interact with uwutranslator, you'll need to mention it. The mention must be in the front of the message in order for the bot to respond.

uwutranslator has a few commands, which are listed below:
- `--help` - displays the help message
- `--ping` - measures the time how long does it take for the bot to interact with Discord
- `--eval` - evals the provided message
> âš  **`eval` command can be accessed by the `developer` only**

If the bot is mentioned and no other arguments are provided, the bot will reply to user with this message:
> Hewwo **[user]**! (^w^)/
I'm uwutranslator, I uwu-ify messages. If you want to check how to use me, use `@`uwutranslator --help command :3

If the bot is mentioned and any other arguments are provided which are not listed here, the bot will "uwu-ify" the message.


<h2 align="center">Contributing</h2>

Contributions are welcomed. Please remember, that the main purpose of this bot is to translate the messages - do not add any more commands which wouldn't fit the purpose of "translating". However, commands which provide more information about the bot, like `--help`, `--ping`, etc. are fine, as well as cases how to uwu-ify the message.


<h2 align="center">Self-hosting</h2>

You are allowed to self-host the bot, but remember to accommodate with the license.  
If you want to self-host, you have to rename the **.env.example** to **.env** and put in the required credentials.
