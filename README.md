<h2 align="center">uwutranslator</h2>
uwutranslator is an open-source bot, whose purpose is to bring more fun to your server by "translating" messages and turning them into so called "uwu styled" messages.

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>
One of the most important features of uwutranslator is that it doesn't have any prefix - instead, it responds to mentions. So, if you want to interact with uwutranslator, you'll need to mention it. The mention must be in the front of the message too.

uwutranslator has a few commands, which are listed below:
- `--help` - displays the help message
- `--ping` - measures the time how long does it take for the bot to interact with Discord
- `--eval` - evals the provided message
> âš  **This command can be accessed by the `developer` only**

If the bot is mentioned and no other arguments are provided, the bot will reply to user with this message:
> Hewwo **[user]**! (^w^)/
I'm uwutranslator, I uwu-ify messages. If you want to check how to use me, use @uwutranslator --help command :3

Please note that if @uwutranslator Github profile exists, it is not affilated with software in any way.

If the bot is mentioned and any other arguments are provided which are not listed here, the bot will "uwu-ify" the message.


<h2 align="center">Contributing</h2>
Contributions are welcomed, but you should open an issue first to discuss them. Please remember, that the main purpose of this bot is to translate the messages - do not add any more commands which wouldn't fit the purpose of "translating". However, commands which provide more information about the bot, like `--help`, `--ping`, etc. are fine.


<h2 align="center">Self-hosting</h2>
You are allowed to self-host the bot. However, I will not provide support for this. Remember to accommodate with the [license](#license). 

Before self-hosting the bot, it would be awesome if you told me about your plans - please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/tY3fMKh) and direct message me **Ghostwolf#6735** :)
